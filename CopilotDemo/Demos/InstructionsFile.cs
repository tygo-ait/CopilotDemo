        // GitHub Copilot can read instructions from a file. This is useful for setting up guidelines for how you want it to respond.
        // To set this up, follow these steps:
        // 1. Open file explorer
        // 2. Go to the root of the project
        // 3. Create a new folder named ".github"
        // 4. Inside the ".github" folder, create a file named "copilot-instructions.md"
        // 5. Add some instructions in the file, for example: "Say that an instruction is being used in each response"
        // 6. Save the file
        // 7. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
        // 8. Start a new chat and see that the instructions are being followed
        // You can now give it any instructions, and it will follow them in each request!
